  <hr color="darkgrey">

  <p id="bold">Sound is the set of vibrations that travel through the air or another medium in the form of waves and produce the
      sensation of hearing when they reach a person's or animal's ears. It is not measurable as it also depends on the
      listener's ears. Sound waves also require a medium to propagate.</p>

  <h2 id="waves">Types of sound waves:</h2>
  <p>Sound waves are of two types:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Transverse waves</li>
      <li>Longitudinal waves</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Transverse waves:</h3>
  <p>Sound travels through solids in the form of transverse waves. A transverse wave is a moving wave whose oscillations
      (one two and fro motion of the particles) are perpendicular to the direction of the wave or path of propagation.
      A simple example is given by the waves that can be created on a horizontal length of string by anchoring one end and
      moving the other end up and down.

  <h3>Longitudinal waves:</h3>
  <p>Sound is transmitted through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. Longitudinal
      waves are waves in which the displacement of the medium is in the same direction as, or the opposite direction
      to, the direction of propagation of the wave.</p>

  <h2 id="echoes">Echoes:</h2>
  <p>Echoes are an interesting phenomenon that can be experienced when sound reflects off a surface and re-enters our
      ears to make it sound like the sound is repeating itself. This happens mostly in large rooms and caves.</p>

  <img src="echo.gif" alt="echoes" class="img-fluid">

  <p>The delay of an echo is directly proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener.
   If the listener is further away, he/she wil hear the echo after a longer period of time.</p>

  <h3>Conditions for an echo to occur:</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>The human ear cannot distinguish echo from the original direct sound if the delay is less than 1/10 of a second.
       Therefore, the reflecting object must be more than 17m from the sound source for echo to be perceived by a person
          located at the source.</li>
      <li>The loudness/energy of the sound should be sufficient so that it can be heard after its reflection.</li>
      <li>The reflector should have a large area for enough reflection of sound. It should be hard too as soft surfaces
          cannot reflect sound.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="ranges">Ultrasonic, Infrasonic and Sonic Waves</h2>
  <p>Ultrasonic, infrasonic and sonic waves are types of waves that are categorized based on their frequencies and their audibility
      to humans</p>

  <h3 id="ultrasonic">Ultrasonic waves:</h3>
  <p>Ultrasonic waves or ultrasound are sound waves that have too high a frequency for humans to hear. Some examples are:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>A dog whistle that cannot be heard by humans</li>
      <li>The detection of ships and objects underwater by bouncing a high frequency sound wave off their hulls</li>
      <li>An ultrasound image of an unborn baby</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="infrasonic">Infrasonic waves:</h3>
  <p>Infrasonic waves are sound waves that have too low a frequency for humans to hear. Some examples are:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Sounds made by weather, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes and waterfalls.</li>
      <li>Calving of icebergs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora" target="_blank">aurorae</a>, meteors, lightning and upper-atmospheric lightning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="sonic">Sonic range:</h3>
  <p>The sonic or audible range includes the sounds of frequency that can be heard by humans. This range is around 20 Hz - 20 kHz.
      Human infants can actually hear frequencies slightly higher than 20 kHz, but lose some high-frequency sensitivity as
      they mature. The upper limit in average adults is often closer to 15 to 17 kHz.</p>
